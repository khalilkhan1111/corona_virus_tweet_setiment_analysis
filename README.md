**Business Use Case:**

The business use case of project is sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing and understanding sentiment patterns in textual data. This task is valuable for businesses, brands, and organizations as it allows them to gain insights into customer opinions, monitor brand reputation, and make data-driven decisions. The project evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-NN Classifier, and Naive Bayes) for sentiment analysis, with the goal of selecting the most effective model for this task.

**Potential Impact:**

1.Understand customer sentiments and opinions.
2. Make data-driven decisions based on customer feedback.
3. Identify trends and patterns in customer sentiments.
4. Improve customer engagement and satisfaction.

**Approach to the Problem Statement:**

Initially had a dataset with 6 columns and 41,157 rows., but narrowed it down to the "OriginalTweet" and "Sentiment" columns, focusing on the relevant data for sentiment analysis. I evaluated three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-NN Classifier, and Naive Bayes, which are commonly used for text classification tasks.

Algorithms: 

I evaluated three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, K-NN Classifier, and Naive Bayes—for sentiment analysis.

Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, outliers, and categorical  encoding. Techniques like label encoding and feature manipulation were employed to create meaningful features. This step was crucial for preparing the data for machine learning modelling


**Challenges:**

Choosing the right features for the models: It can be difficult to determine which features are most important for sentiment analysis tasks.

Training and evaluating the models: It can be time-consuming to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.


**Future scope:**

Sentiment Visualization: Creating visualizations or dashboards to present sentiment trends over time. Scaling: Scaling the sentiment analysis system to handle larger volumes of data.
